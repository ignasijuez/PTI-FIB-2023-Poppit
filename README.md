# Project developed in PTI-FIB

## Introduction
Our project, Poppit, addresses ticket resale issues using NFC technology to link tickets to unique identifiers in devices, preventing unauthorized resale. It limits ticket purchases per user and includes a resale feature benefiting both sellers and event organizers.

## Motivation
Ticket resale has surged, leading to high prices and limited access for genuine fans. Our app connects fans directly with legitimate sellers, eliminating intermediaries. It includes verification mechanisms to ensure only valid tickets are available, creating a fair and secure ticket-buying experience.
